# movies-etl

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to leverage ETL techniques in order to create a database in pgAdmin for future use. With the help of python and jupyter notebook, data from large csv and json files underwent various transformations and were loaded into data tables. The overall outcome was fully automated ETL pipeline that is able to repeat this process with new data and load it into existing tables.
